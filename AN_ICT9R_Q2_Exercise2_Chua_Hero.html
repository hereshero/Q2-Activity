			<p class="para1"><span>[Verse 1:]</span><br>
			Combat, I'm ready for combat<br>
			I say I don't want that, but what if I do?<br>
			'Cause cruelty wins in the movies<br>
			I've got a hundred thrown-out speeches I almost said to you<br><br>


			<span>[Verse 2:]</span><br>
			Easy they come, easy they go<br>
			I jump from the train, I ride off alone<br>
			I never grew up, it's getting so old<br>
			Help me hold onto you
<br>

<br>
			<span>[Verse 3:]</span><br>

			I've been the archer<br>
			I've been the prey<br>
			Who could ever leave me, darling?<br>
			But who could stay?<br>

			<br>

			<span>[Verse 4:]</span><br>

			Dark side, I search for your dark side<br>
			But what if I'm alright, right, right, right here?<br>
			And I cut off my nose just to spite my face<br>
			Then I hate my reflection for years and years<br>
<br>
			<span>[Verse 5:]</span><br>
			I wake in the night, I pace like a ghost<br>
			The room is on fire, invisible smoke<br>
			And all of my heroes die all alone<br>
			Help me hold onto you<br>

			<span>[Verse 6]</span><br>
			I've been the archer<br>
			I've been the prey<br>
			Who could ever leave me, darling?<br>
			But who could stay?<br>
			(I see right through me, I see right through me)

			<span>[Bridge]</span><br><br>

			'Cause they see right through me <br>
			They see right through me  <br>  
			They see right through <br>  
			Can you see right through me? <br>  
			They see right through <br>  
			They see right through me <br>  
			I see right through me <br>  
			I see right through me <br>  
<br>

			<p class="para2"><span>[Verse 7]</span><br>
			All the king's horses, all the king's men <br>
			Couldn't put me together again <br> 
			Cause all of my enemies started out friends <br> 
			Help me hold onto you <br>
<br>
			<span>[Outro]</span><br>
			I've been the archer <br> 
			I've been the prey <br>
			Who could ever leave me, darling? <br>
			But who could stay? <br> 
			(I see right through me, I see right through me) <br> 
			Who could stay? <br> 
			Who could stay? <br>
			Who could stay? <br>
			You could stay <br>
			You could stay <br>
			You <br>
